  These are some the new contents of the beta. Of cause, if you want to have a try, please delete the file of called "destroys" and then take the file of called “destroys_beta” to name it “destroys”. But these new contents are only beta. I’m not sure they can function perfectly. But I’ll perfect them next version (or longer time).
